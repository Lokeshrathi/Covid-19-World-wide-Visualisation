# Covid-19-World-wise-Visualisation

## Inspiration
- This Notebook was created to depict the world wide effect of Corona Virus on the world. Someone who wants to know the statistics about the cases (Death, Recovered, Active, Confirmed) can have a look at this notebook and gain insights on the pandemic.

## Data Collection
- Data was collected from Kaggle.
- You can find my kernel at [link](https://www.kaggle.com/lokeshrth4617/covid-19-world-wise-visualization).

## Data Visualisation
- The following graph shows the effect of the Virus around the world

- The number of cases has exponentially taken a leap in a very less time.*Lockdown wasn't imposed yet*
- One of the reasons why the **government imposed the Lockdown was this sudden increase in graph**, as the pandemic was spreading through **no social distancing** and people not wearing mask.
 
 ### Let us view the top 20 countries which had the highest effect due to the pandemic
 -  Firstly, let us look at the countries with **highest number of active cases.**

 - This graph clearly shows that Italy has the most number of Active cases. It is known that the spread in Italy was very high and the government took steps after the spike.
 
 -- **Top 20 countries with highest number of Deaths Cases.**

- This graph Shows that Italy has faced the highest number of deaths compared to the other countries.

- **Top 20 countries with highest number of recovered Cases.**

- This graph clearly shows that China has the maximum number of Recovered cases. We know that this virus originated in WUHAN and saw the effects right away. Since then China had taken strict actions for the Lockdown in the country, which was later followed by all other governments in the World.

### Comparision 
- A comparision between 4 countries in the world is depicted here,
 1. China
 2. US
 3. Italy
 4. India.
 
 - Comparision 1 (**Deaths**)
 ![](https://github.com/Lokeshrathi/Covid-19-World-wise-Visualisation/blob/master/Images/Deaths.png)
 
  - There is a huge spike in the number of Death cases in Italy.
  - For china, we can see that the graph didnt rise up alot due to the Early Lockdown that was imposed in the country
  - The number of Deaths in India has been very minimal compared to others.
 
 - Comparision 2 (**Recovered**)
 ![](https://github.com/Lokeshrathi/Covid-19-World-wise-Visualisation/blob/master/Images/Recover.png)
 
 - We see that the Recovery cases has been highest by China due the Lockdown imposed.
 - The Recovery for Italy has been very less, which shows that the rules were not followed properly by the public and proper steps were not taken by the Government to put a hold at the pandemic

 - Comaparision 3 (**Confirmed**)
 ![](https://github.com/Lokeshrathi/Covid-19-World-wise-Visualisation/blob/master/Images/Confirmed.png)
 
 - Compared to other countries
    - China has the most Confirmed cases
    - India has the least number of confirmed cases
    - The cases has increased over the period of time by a large number in Italy
